**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, here's a project plan for building the NFT purchase application, based on the requirements you've outlined.  This is a high-level plan, suitable for initial project setup and tracking.  We can break down each task into smaller sub-tasks as needed.

**Project: NFT Purchase Application**

**Goal:** Develop a web application that allows users to purchase premium NFTs using 100 CRAFT tokens on the Solana blockchain and receive the NFT in web, email, and SVG formats.

**Phases:**

1.  **Planning & Design (Estimated Duration: 1 week)**
2.  **Backend Development (Estimated Duration: 3 weeks)**
3.  **Frontend Development (Estimated Duration: 3 weeks)**
4.  **Integration & Testing (Estimated Duration: 2 weeks)**
5.  **Deployment & Monitoring (Estimated Duration: 1 week)**

**1. Planning & Design (1 week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Requirement Refinement:**  Further clarify any ambiguous requirements (e.g., specific user authentication method, email service to be used, detailed UI/UX design).
    *   **Technical Design:** Define the architecture of the application, including database schema, API endpoints, Solana interaction strategy, and NFT generation process.
    *   **UI/UX Design:** Create mockups and wireframes for the React frontend.  Focus on user flow for purchasing NFTs.
    *   **Security Assessment:** Identify potential security vulnerabilities and plan mitigation strategies.
    *   **Infrastructure Setup:** Choose and configure necessary services (e.g., hosting, database, email service).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Detailed requirements document.
    *   Technical design document.
    *   UI/UX mockups and wireframes.
    *   Security plan.
    *   Infrastructure setup plan.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Solana Wallet Integration:**  Research and select appropriate Solana wallet integration libraries for React.
    *   **Solana API:**  Determine which Solana API libraries or SDKs will be used in the Python backend.
    *   **NFT Metadata Standard:** Decide on a standard for storing NFT metadata (e.g., Metaplex).
    *   **SVG Generation Library:** Choose a suitable Python library for generating SVG images.
    *   **Database Choice:** Select a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) based on scalability and data storage requirements.

**2. Backend Development (3 weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Solana Integration:** Implement the logic to interact with the Solana blockchain to:
        *   Verify user balance of CRAFT tokens.
        *   Execute the transaction for purchasing the NFT.
        *   Monitor transaction status.
    *   **API Development:**  Build REST API endpoints for:
        *   Fetching NFT information.
        *   Initiating NFT purchase.
        *   Retrieving transaction status.
        *   User authentication (if required).
    *   **NFT Generation:** Implement the logic to generate SVG images for NFTs.
    *   **Data Storage:**  Implement database schema and logic to store transaction details and NFT ownership.
    *   **Email Service Integration:** Integrate with the chosen email service to deliver NFTs.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Fully functional backend API.
    *   Database schema and implementation.
    *   NFT generation module.
    *   Email service integration.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Solana Transaction Handling:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for Solana transactions.
    *   **CRAFT Token Address:** Ensure the correct Solana address for the CRAFT token is used.
    *   **API Security:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect API endpoints.
    *   **Background Tasks:** Use background tasks (e.g., Celery) to handle asynchronous operations like NFT generation and email sending.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

**3. Frontend Development (3 weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **UI Implementation:**  Develop the React components based on the UI/UX design.
    *   **Solana Wallet Integration:** Integrate with the user's Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to enable transaction signing.
    *   **API Integration:**  Consume the backend API endpoints to:
        *   Display available NFTs.
        *   Initiate NFT purchase.
        *   Display transaction status.
        *   Allow users to access their purchased NFTs.
    *   **User Authentication (if required):** Implement user authentication flow.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Fully functional React frontend.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **React Component Library:**  Consider using a React component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) for consistent styling and UI components.
    *   **State Management:** Use a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage application state.
    *   **Wallet Connection Management:** Implement robust wallet connection and disconnection handling.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement user-friendly error messages for common errors (e.g., insufficient balance, transaction failure).

**4. Integration & Testing (2 weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **End-to-End Testing:**  Test the entire application flow, from NFT purchase to delivery.
    *   **Security Testing:**  Perform security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    *   **Performance Testing:**  Test the application's performance under load.
    *   **Usability Testing:**  Gather feedback from users on the application's usability.
    *   **Bug Fixing:**  Fix any bugs identified during testing.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Fully tested and integrated application.
    *   Bug fix reports.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Test Automation:**  Implement automated tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Consider conducting security audits by external experts.
    *   **Monitoring Tools:**  Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and identify potential issues.

**5. Deployment & Monitoring (1 week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a production environment.
    *   **Configuration:** Configure the application for production use.
    *   **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and alerting to track application health and performance.
    *   **Documentation:**  Create documentation for users and developers.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Deployed and configured application.
    *   Monitoring setup.
    *   User and developer documentation.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
    *   **Scalability:**  Ensure the application is scalable to handle increasing traffic.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Follow security best practices for deployment and configuration.

**Communication & Collaboration:**

*   Regular stand-up meetings to track progress and identify roadblocks.
*   Use a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) to manage tasks and track progress.
*   Use a communication platform (e.g., Slack, Discord) for team communication.

**Success Metrics:**

*   Successful NFT purchases.
*   User satisfaction.
*   Application performance and uptime.
*   Security vulnerabilities identified and fixed.

This plan provides a starting point for the project.  Remember to adapt it as needed based on your specific requirements and resources. Good luck!
